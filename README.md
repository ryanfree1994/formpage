# formpage

Creating a form page is the second of five responsive web challenges provided by freecodecamp.org. Here is a link to the challenge: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form

The focus of the challenge was to develop a form that follows CSS and responsive web best practices (Note: the form did not need to submit actual values. This will be addressed in future challenge). The challenge needed to pass 10 tests, which can be viewed in Codepen: https://codepen.io/ryanfreeland/pen/gOrZNjz

My challenge passed all 10 tests and is compatible across Safari, Google Chrome, and Opera browsers.

I built a coffee insights survey, as I am obsessed with coffee and I think this tool could be used by some coffee companies.
